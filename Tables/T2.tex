\footnotesize Notes: Dependent variable is an indicator for either \emph{(a)} graduating in a STEM field, unconditional on education level; \emph{(b)} graduating with a bachelor's degree in any field; or \emph{(c)} graduating with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field. Foreign STEM Exposure denotes the effect of a 10 percentage point increase in the share of foreign STEM workers on the dependent variable. Each coefficient is estimated from a separate linear probability model. The mean of the dependent variable for the control group is reported in brackets. *Statistically significant at the .10 level; ** at the .05 level.
