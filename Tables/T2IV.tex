\footnotesize Notes: Dependent variable is an indicator for either \emph{(a)} graduating in a STEM field, unconditional on education level; \emph{(b)} graduating with a bachelor's degree in any field; or \emph{(c)} graduating with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field. Each coefficient is estimated from a different linear probability model using two-stage least squares, where 1990-2000 foreign STEM growth is instrumented by 1980 foreign STEM exposure. *Statistically significant at the .10 level.
