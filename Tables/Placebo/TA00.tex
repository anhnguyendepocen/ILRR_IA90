\footnotesize Note: This table presents results from a placebo setting where we consider individuals who turn 18 years old between 1981-1989, and where we consider 1985 as the year the policy was instituted. Individuals turning 18 in 1986-1989 are considered to be treated, while those turning 18 in 1981-1984 serve as controls. The reported estimates should be compared with those reported in the first column of Table \ref{tab:STEMgradUncond} Panel C, the third column of Table \ref{tab:STEMoccEmpAll} Panel B, and the last column of Table \ref{tab:ProbLY} Panel B.
