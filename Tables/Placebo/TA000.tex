\footnotesize Note: This table presents results from a setting where we consider individuals who turn 18 years old between 1982-1994, with 1990 as the year the policy was instituted. Individuals turning 18 in 1986-1989 are considered to be one treatment group, those turning 18 in 1991-1994 as a different treatment group, and those turning 18 in 1982-1985 serve as controls. The reported estimates should be compared with those reported in the first column of Table \ref{tab:STEMgradUncond} Panel C, the third column of Table \ref{tab:STEMoccEmpAll} Panel B, and the last column of Table \ref{tab:ProbLY} Panel B.
