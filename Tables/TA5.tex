\footnotesize Notes: This table estimates our main regression model using a discretized version of exposure. States are classified as low-, medium-, or high-exposure based on terciles of the exposure distribution. The coefficients reported represent the change in the outcome variable by moving across exposure terciles (either from low to medium or from low to high). *Statistically significant at the .10 level; ** at the .05 level; *** at the .01 level.
