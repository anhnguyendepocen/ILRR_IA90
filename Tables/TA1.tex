\footnotesize Notes: This table presents sensitivity of our results as we change the number of birth cohorts in the sample. Panel A includes those turning 18 between 1985 and 1995 (excluding 1990). Panel B includes year age 18 cohorts between 1994 and 1996 (excluding 1990). Panel C includes those turning 18 between 1986 and 1994, including 1990. *Statistically significant at the .10 level; ** at the .05 level; *** at the .01 level.
