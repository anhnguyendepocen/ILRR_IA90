\footnotesize Notes: Dependent variable is an indicator for either \emph{(a)} unemployment; \emph{(b)} not participating in labor force; or \emph{(c)} working at all in the previous five years. All samples are conditional on graduation in a STEM field. *Statistically significant at the .10 level; ** at the .05 level; *** at the .01 level.
