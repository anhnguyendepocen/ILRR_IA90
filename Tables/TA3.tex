\footnotesize Notes: Panel A adds as an additional control the 1980 share of native college graduates in the state employed in STEM occupations interacted with the post-IA90 dummy. Panel B adds as an additional control the 1990 share of native college graduates in the state employed in STEM occupations interacted with the post-IA90 dummy. Panel C excludes all time-varying state control variables. *Statistically significant at the .10 level; ** at the .05 level; *** at the .01 level.
